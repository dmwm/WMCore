"""
When to use this script: when a workflow is in status "aborted" but
it still has active GQEs.

Use this script to mimic exactly the same action as the one taken
by ReqMgr2 when aborting a workflow (without a state transition).

This script will mark the global workqueue elements - for a given
workflow - as CancelRequested, such that the agents can proceed
and acknowledge it, moving elements to status Canceled.
