### This is a bit messy! We do not have all the necessary COMP packages under all
# the CMSSW ScramArch. So, for many ScramArchs not supported by COMP, what we did
# was to make a symlink in CVMFS to packages provided under a given CMSSW branch.
#
### A summary of our current setup is:
# slc7_amd64_gcc630 (standard COMP): py2-future/0.18.2 python/2.7.13 py3-future/0.18.2 python3/3.8.2
# slc6_amd64_gcc700 (from CMSSW): py2-future/0.16.0 py3-future/0.18.2 python3/3.6.4
# slc7_ppc64le_gcc630 (from CMSSW): py2-future/0.18.2 python/2.7.15 py3-future/0.18.2 python3/3.8.2
# slc6_ppc64le_gcc493 (from CMSSW): py2-future/0.18.2 python/2.7.15 py3-future/0.18.2 python3/3.8.2
#
# NOTE: all the ppc64le ScramArchs are actually pointing to: slc7_ppc64le_gcc820
