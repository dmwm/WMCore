Since ReqMgr depends on Oracle, CouchDB stores and they are inconsistent
with each other, these tools are supposed to help straighten things out
(dumpers, checkers/comparators, updaters ...).


Utilities for:
    - dumping Oracle ReqMgr database into Python dictionaries
    - comparison / consistency between ReqMgr Oracle database and CouchDB
    - ultimate goal is to drop Oracle database from ReqMgr, keeping data only
        in CouchDB
    - as of 2013-01-16, ReqMgr Oracle database dump (in Python dictionaries)
        is slightly under 900MB, approx. half is in the reqmgr_message table

Dump the entire Oracle database:
	python ./oracle_dump.py user/password@server > oracle_dump.py


Consistency check of the requests (reqmgr_request table and CouchDB) (on VM):
cd /data
source /data/current/apps/reqmgr/etc/profile.d/init.sh
# dump only reqmgr_request table
python /data/current/apps/reqmgr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/WMCore/ReqMgr/database_cleanup/oracle_dump.py user/pass@cms_reqmgr reqmgr_request > oracle_dump_request_table.py
python /data/current/apps/reqmgr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/WMCore/ReqMgr/database_cleanup/oracle_couchdb_comparison.py oracle_dump_request_table.py > comparison.log
