The following are guidelines for development in WMCORE. 
If you are working for an external project you are advized to
follow these guidelines too for that project as it helps 
to create a consistent structure for code development and testing
which minimizes maintenance and debugging.

If you have any problem with using the instructions in 
this document, please contact the 
quality officer as  he/she can assist you. The information in
this document perhaps not always completete but giving your
feedback will help improving it for all developers.

SETUP
=====
To setup the library it is assumed the following conditions
hold:

-You have a recent version of the prodagent installed (this
is mainly used for dependency package compliance such as mysql, 
etcs..
-Edit the WMCORE/standards/setup.sh file appropriately
-If you are integrating this with an exterenal package make sure these
settings are set correctly too

so typically you would have something like this:

source your external package setup.sh
source the WMCORE setup.sh

Also edit any other setup_* files as you see fit.

If you want to run the tests. Read the section on Testing.

Assuming you want to run a specific test with a sepcific backend you can 
do the following:

edit the 'test_code' file and comment out the backends you do not want to test
(e.g. oracle)

edit the 'conf_test_mysql.py' and locate the test you want to test. (e.g. ProxyTest)

Copy paste this code after the last test is loaded. It empties the tests array and only
inserts your speicific test:

tests = []

try:
   x=ProxyTest()
   tests.append((x,"fvlingen"))
except Exception,ex:
   if not errors.has_key("fvlingen"):
       errors["fvlingen"] = []
   errors["fvlingen"].append(("ProxyTest",str(ex)))

Save the file and execute test_code

Note: when you first run the tests mysql will initialize things and for some 
reason some tests fail for the first time. Running them again (after mysql 
is initialized) makes them succeed.

CODE STANDARD:
=============
Use pylint and the pylint test file located under:
WMCORE/standards/.pylintrc

Test files need to be located under WMCORE/test/python/ and
need to mirror the structure you use for the packages under
WMCORE/src/python where every directory and test file is 
augmented with a _t and the class should be augmented with 'TEST'
If you develop for an external package you mimic this structure
in the external package directory structure.

E.g.: if you have a package:

src/python/WMCORE/MsgService/MsgService.py

you will have a test in the pacakge:

test/python/WMCORE_t/MsgService_t/MsgService_t.py and in it
class: MsgserviceTest.

When developing a component use the following structure:

for component file that inherits from the harness:
....WMComponent/<component name>/<component name.py>

for config file:
....WMComponent/<component name>/DefaultConfig.py

WMCORE/bin/wmcore-new-config is a config file aggregator that takes
as input directories roots and aggregates the config files. This enables 
operators to generate one config file and edit it as they see fit. Beware that 
if you import a DefaultConfig.py file in your DefaultConfig.py file this
can give errors when generating this file as it would overwrite existing
values.

for storing the message handlers:

...WMComponent/<component name>/Handler

If you work on an external project you will work with a different 
root than .../WMComponent

All files should be tested against the .pylintrc format and need 
to get a minimum score of 8 or higher. In case that is not possible 
due to certain language constructs being used, the pylint style file 
can be accomodated to reflect this.

Potential log files for tests should have a name: <testfile>.log
So in case of the MsgService_t.py you get a MsgService_t.log file

If components contain parameters they should be defined in a file 
'DefaultConfig.py' using the WMCORE/src/python/WMCore/Agent/Configuration 
module.

the WMCORE WMQuality.TestInit class contains a set of methods used often
in testing for doing mundane stuff such as setting up connections. It is 
recommended that you use them to facilitate maintainability.

The TestInit class is based on the WMCORE/src/python/WMCore/WMInit class. It 
contains a set of often used methods for conveniently dealing with various 
mundane things such as database setup or initialization.

To facilitate using methods from the TestInit class for loading schemas put 
create statements in a ...<backend>/Create.py method following a similar 
structure as can be found in the Create.py methods in the wmcore module 
MsgService and Trigger. Backend has either the value Oracle or MySQL
 
RESERVED WORDS:
==============
To prevent having to pass (a potential growing) number of parameters to 
classes, there will be several reserved attributes in the thread class 
to facilitate ease of use of much used objects. Below a list and how 
you can assign them. These attributes enable (on a thread level) to 
change values of certain often used objects (e.g. switching database 
access parameters). It is not obligatory to use them just do not use 
them in any other way than described here.

import threading
myThread = threading.currentThread()
# pointer to the logger used in the module
myThread.logger
# pointer to current database interface object (WMCore.Database.DBInterface)
myThread.dbi
# the current database transaction object used (WMCore.Database.Transaction)
myThread.transaction
# A dictionary of factories. Factories are instantiated with a namespace (e.g. WMCore.MsgService.MySQL) and load the appropriate objects. This is especially useful if you  work with multiple backends.
myThread.factory
# A String representing the backend. Currently there are 3: "MySQL", "Oracle", "SQLite" . These backends are used to define the proper namespace for importing data access objects (DAO) from factories.
# E.g. I can define a namespace: "WMCore.MsgService"+myThread.backend . 
myThread.backend
# pointer to current message service object being used
myThread.msgService
# pointer to current trigger service object being used
myThread.trigger
# pointer to arguments used by this component
myThread.args
#  dictionary of transactions. It is an (optional) possibility 
# to synchronize commits to multiple databases (or the same database)
myThread.transactions

DEVELOPMENT:
===========

Development follows typically the following (iterative) cycle:

(1) Develop your module(s) in src/python/WMCore or src/python/WMComponent
or if you develop for a dependent project something like: src/python/Component

(2) Use the WMCORE/standards/test_style.sh script to generate a style
report and improve your code until it (at least) reaches the rating threshold
(currently 8)

(3) Check/edit the WMCORE/setup.py file to see if your package is listed.
If not add it to the packages list. This is used by the package builder 
for new releases. If you develop for another project update that setup.py 
file.

(4) Develop your tests in .../test/python mirroring the structure in src/python
(4.1) Make sure that the database access parameters (and other relevant
parameters)  are extracted from the environment variables of the setup* files. 
Currently it assumes that there is one database per backend (except
for the proxy test case). If you need more databases than are currently defined
in the setup files, add these environment variables to the appropriate setup files
Unless: these variables will be specific to this one test , or these
test are for an external package (in which case you need to update the
setup files of that package).

(5) (Optional as this can be autogenerated by package quality officer).
Add your module and/or files (including your tests) you develop to 
the WMCore/standards/test_style file, with your unique identifier in the 
packages list. This is used by the quality officer to find the responsible 
person in case of quality audits (e.g. testing). Note that you can add either 
individual files or whole subdirs.  If your responsible for a whole subdir add 
this whole subdir. External projects should create or generate their own 
test_style file in their own project package. The test_style file can be generated
using the test_generate script (this is the task of the quality officer).
External projects need to create their own test_generate script (copy the
WMCORE one and modify it, is the easiest way). This scripts also generates
the test suite files.

(6)Develop your tests in test/python mirroring the structure in src/python
(6.1) Make sure that the database access parameters (and other relevant
parameters)  are extracted from the environment variables of the setup* files. 
Currently it assumes that there is one database assume per backend (except
for the proxy test case). If you need more databases than are currently defined
in the setup files, add these environment variables to the appropriate setup files
Unless: these variables will be specific to this one test or if you develop
for an external package in which case you need to add them to the settings 
files of that project.

(7) (Optional as this can be autogenerated by quality officer).
When your test is finalized add it to the appropriate backend (some 
test might need to be added to multiple backends) in the config_<backend>.py
file. You import the test module and add a tuple (test instance, and your unique
id) to the test array. Your id (e.g. name) is used by the quality officer in 
case of anomalies during testing. If you work for an external project you 
need to add it at the appropriate test suite for that project.

DEVELOPMENT (DATABASES)
======================

Some components have their own database tables. In order to prevent name clashes
prefix your tables with something that easily associates it to the component.

Some examples that are being used:

ms_  MsgService
tp_  ThreadPool
err_ ErrorHandler
tr_  Trigger



TESTING:
=======

This directory also contains several files. The following prefixes
are used:

setup  : files for setting your environment. These are the only 
files you need to edit when running the tests on your machine. Different 
backends (mysql and oracle) have there own setup files (setup_mysql.sh, 
setup_oracle.sh) that are used in the various test files (to prevent 
having to hardcode these variables in the tests themselves.

clean  : cleans generated log files, pyc files, etc... Separate files 
are available for the different backends.

start  : startup scripts for the various backends.

config_test : enables you to config the different tests for different backends
 before running

test   : actually test scripts. Currently there are 4 scripts. Two 
for the code style, one for the code itself and a script (test_generate)
which generates the actual test_style, test_code, config_test_mysql.py
and config_test_oracle.py files by analyzing the cvs repository log
(requires access to the cvs repository to generate log)

NOTE: if you test ensure you are testing using the environment that is packaged
with wmcor applications (e.g. you can install for example the latest prodagent
rpms and source this environment (minus the prodagent and prodcommon python libraries).

test_generate
-------------

This script generates various files to prepare for testing.
During generation it also provides a report for test files that
do not use the proper convention for importing tests (level 1 failure)
it writes these to failures1.log

Note: the test_generate script should be used mainly to generate
the initial test configurations. After that these configuration
can be tweeked manually and committed incrementally.

The test_generate script generates various test configurations.
Before running them edit them (e.g. you might want to remove 
some tests for certain backends).

When you run the actual tests using the test_code script
it will again generate a report which highlights the tests that could
not be instantiated (level 2 failure). By default these failures
are written to failures2.log, however since we test with multiple 
backends it it desirable to edit this filename in the 
multiple generated conf_test*.py files (e.g. failure2_mysql.log
and failures2_oracle.log)

Finally the tests that are run can generate errors (level 3 failure).
By default these errors and failures are written to failures3.log.
Edit the name of this file so the different backends write to 
unique files.

Note: that some tests require an empty database. If tests preceding 
a this test do not empty the database this might result in errors 
for this test. The test framework cleans the default database
but this might not be sufficient.

Note: when generating the tests and style checks the mapping from 
developer to module might not be correct. For example if user 'fvlingen'
has moved files to a new directory for better organization he
might be associated to modules he did not develop.

After generation check the generated files and adapt them appropriately
also check what tests you want to run for mysql, oracle or both.

Once all files are configured appropriately you typically do:

(1) source setup.sh
(2) (optional and usually only done by the quality officer) ./test_generate.sh
(3) (optional) edit the mapping in the generated files
(4) ./test_style
(5) ./test_code

(repeat 4 and 5 if necessary)

The test scripts generate a summary when anomalies occur.


a set of .sh files to setup and run tests

-edit the setup*.sh scripts to reflect your settings (it assumes you use the cms packages 
for running the tests (e.g. mysql, sqlalchemy).
-source the setup.sh file (once)

(optional) edit the test.sh file to disable some tests.
run test.sh  (repeat as necessary)

After sourcing setup.sh you can also test your code quality
using the quality.sh command. Either invoke
quality.sh with a file or directory, or edit 
the myfiles.sh script to run quality tests on several
dirs. If you name your output files quality*.txt, 
cleanup.sh will automatically remove them when invoked.

OTHER PROJECTS
==============

To facilitate uniformity and reuse of code we strongly advise that you follow the structure
outlined in this document for your project where possible. In particular following the same
code style standards and layout.

E.g. for the ProdAgent project components will be sub directories in:
PRODAGENT/src/python/PA/PAComponent

And tests for these components will be sub directories in:

PRODAGENT/test/python/PA_t/PAComponent_t

If components contain parameters they should be defined in a file 'DefaultConfig.py'
using the WMCORE/src/python/WMCore/Agent/Configuration module.

the WMCORE WMQuality.TestInit class contains a set of methods used often
in testing for doing mundane stuff such as setting up connections. It is recommended
that you use them to facilitate maintainability.

To facilitate using methods from the TestInit class for loading schemas put create
statements in a ...<backend>/Create.py method following a similar structure as can
be found in the Create.py methods in the wmcore module MsgService and Trigger. Backend
has either the value Oracle or MySQL
