"""
The DBSUpload algorithm

This code, all of which is in uploadDatasets works in three parts.
Each part is carried out in its own database transaction.

1) Find all files that have not yet been uploaded to DBS,
   and the fileset-algo pairs that go along with them.
2) Upload these files.  This is handled through DBSInterface
   which first sends the algo, then the dataset, and then
   commits all of the files.  It also handles migrating to
   global is you specify a global URL and the file blocks are
   full (have reached the limit in the DBS config)
3) The code cleans up at the end, check for any open blocks
   that have exceeded their timeout.


NOTE: This is complicated as hell, because you can have a
dataset-algo pair where BOTH the dataset and the algo are in
DBS attached to different objects.  You have to scan for a pair
that is not in DBS, decide whether its components are in DBS,
add them, and then add the files.  This is why everything is
so convoluted.
