            is stuck in executing code in kernel space.
          * Blocking System Calls:
            When a process is stuck in a system call (e.g. waiting for I/O).
          * Unkillable process:
            When a process does not respond to any signals, e.g. stuck in an Uninterruptable
            Sleep state. Which means, it cannot be woken by any signal, not even SIGKILL.
