"""
A simple watchdog mechanism based on OS signal handling, implemented to help in the monitoring
of the health of all WMAgent components.

This AgentWatchdogScanner thread is to be scanning all other components' process trees
and will take the proper (restart) actions in case of unhealthy component is found.
While at the same time the AgentWatchdogPoller is to be endowed with a mechanism
to monitor for run time overflow in all agent components and will take care of
proper restarts of the misbehaved ones.


And we shall call this component with the affectionate nickname: Cerberus ;)
