OpsClipboard. CouchApp for Operations.

Application aimed at internal, Ops-only, marking of requests.
A request, from WMAgent point of view, has clearly defined states during
its life time. Ops need finer granularity states, sometimes not solidly
defined. OpsClipboard allows for this additional routing.
