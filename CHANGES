Everything what was needed for me is to put site-local-config.xml in afs directory and run jobs at CERN. Can you put somewhere modified site-local-config.xml that it is accessible in WN? Changes which I did to this file are:    <local-stage-out>      <command value="gfal2"/>      <option value=""/>      <catalog url="trivialcatalog_file:/afs/cern.ch/cms/SITECONF/T2_CH_CERN/PhEDEx/storage.xml?protocol=srmv2"/>

Everything what was needed for me is to put site-local-config.xml in afs directory and run jobs at CERN. Can you put somewhere modified site-local-config.xml that it is accessible in WN? Changes which I did to this file are:    <local-stage-out>      <command value="gfal2"/>      <option value=""/>      <catalog url="trivialcatalog_file:/afs/cern.ch/cms/SITECONF/T2_CH_CERN/PhEDEx/storage.xml?protocol=srmv2"/>

Without adler32 it works as expected, and as far as I understand, CERN will not change to gfal2. Tapas, I have agent fully set up with this patch, and let me know if you have some time to test. Everything what was needed for me is to put site-local-config.xml in afs directory and run jobs at CERN. Can you put somewhere modified site-local-config.xml that it is accessible in WN?

Everything what was needed for me is to put site-local-config.xml in afs directory and run jobs at CERN. Can you put somewhere modified site-local-config.xml that it is accessible in WN?
