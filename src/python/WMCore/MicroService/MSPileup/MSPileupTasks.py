        existent rules

        This task is supposed to look at pileup documents active in the system.

        rules (and nothing beyond them), according to the pileup object
        configuration. Pileup documents that are updated as a result of this
        logic should have their data persisted back in MongoDB.

        1. Read pileup document from MongoDB with filter active=true
        2. if expectedRSEs is different than currentRSEs, then further data placement
        is required (it's possible that data removal is required!)
        3. make a local copy of the currentRSEs value to track rules incomplete but ongoing
        4. for each rule matching the DID + Rucio account, perform:
           - if rule RSE is not in expectedRSEs, then this rule needs to be deleted.
             - upon successful rule deletion, also remove the RSE name
             from currentRSEs and ruleIds (if any)
             - make a log record
           - else, save this rule RSE in the local copy of currentRSEs.
           This rule is likely still being processed by Rucio.
        5. now that we evaluated expected versus current,
        for each expectedRSEs not in our local copy of currentRSEs:
           - first, check whether the RSE has enough available space available for that
           (we can assume that any storage with less than 1 TB available cannot be
           considered for pileup data placement)
             - in case of no space available, make a log record
           - in case there is enough space, make a Rucio rule for
           that DID + Rucio account + RSE
             - now append the rule id to the ruleIds list
