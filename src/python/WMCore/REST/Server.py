class RESTFrontPage(object):
    """Base class for a trivial front page intended to hand everything
    over to a javascript-based user interface implementation.

    This front-page simply serves static content like HTML pages, CSS,
    JavaScript and images from number of configurable document roots.
    Text content such as CSS and JavaScript can be scrunched together,
    or combo-loaded, from several files. All the content supports the
    standard ETag and last-modified validation for optimal caching.

    The base class assumes the actual application consists of a single
    front-page, which loads JavaScript and other content dynamically,
    and uses HTML5 URL history features to figure out what to do. That
    is, given application mount point <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/app>, all
    links such as <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/app/foo/bar?q=xyz> get mapped
    to the same page, which then figures out what to do at /foo/bar
    relative location or with the query string part.

    There is a special response for ``rest/preamble.js`` static file.
    This will automatically generate a scriptlet of the following form,
    plus any additional content passed in `preamble`::

      var REST_DEBUG = (debug_mode),
          REST_SERVER_ROOT = "(mount)",
          REST_INSTANCES = [{ "id": "...", "title": "...", "rank": N }...];

    REST_DEBUG, ``debug_mode``
      Is set to true/false depending on the value of the constructor
      :ref:`debug_mode` parameter, or if the default None, it's set
      to false if running with minimised assets, i.e. frontpage matches
      ``*-min.html``, true otherwise.

    REST_SERVER_ROOT, ``mount``
      The URL mount point of this object, needed for history init. Taken
      from the constructor argument.

    REST_INSTANCES
      If the constructor is given `instances`, its return value is turned
      into a sorted JSON list of available instances for JavaScript. Each
      database instance should have the dictionary keys "``.title``" and
      "``.order``" which will be used for human visible instance label and
      order of appearance, respectively. The ``id`` is the label to use
      for REST API URL construction: the instance dictionary key. This
      variable will not be emitted at all if :ref:`instances` is None.

    .. rubric:: Attributes

    .. attribute:: _app

       Reference to the application object given to the constructor.

    .. attribute:: _mount

       The mount point given in the constructor.

    .. attribute:: _static

       The roots given to the constructor, with ``rest/preamble.js`` added.

    .. attribute:: _frontpage

       The name of the front page file.

    .. attribute:: _substitutions

       Extra (name, value) substitutions for `_frontpage`. When serving
       the front-page via `_serve()`, each ``@name@`` is replaced by its
       corresponding `value`.

    .. attribute:: _embeddings

       Extra (name, value) file replacements for `_frontpage`. Similar to
       `_substitutions` but each value is a list of file names, and the
       replacement value is the concatenation of all the contents of all
       the files, with leading and trailing white space removed.

    .. attribute:: _preamble

       The ``rest/preamble.js`` computed as described above.

    .. attribute:: _time

       Server start-up time, used as mtime for ``rest/preamble.js``.

class MiniRESTApi(object):
    """Minimal base class for REST services.

    .. rubric:: Overview

    This is the main base class for the CherryPy-based REST API interfaces.
    It provides a minimal interface for registering API methods to be called
    via REST HTTP calls. Normally implementations should derive from the
    :class:`~.RESTApi` higher level abstraction.

    Instances of this class maintain a table of handlers associated to HTTP
    method (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, or DELETE) and an API word. The given API
    word may support any number of different HTTP methods by associating
    them to the different, or even same, callables. Each such API may be
    associated with arbitrary additional arguments, typically options to
    adapt behaviour for the API as described below.

    Each API handler must be associated to a validation method which will
    be given the remaining URL path and query arguments. The validator
    must *verify* the incoming arguments and *move* safe input to output
    arguments, typically using :mod:`~.RESTValidation` utilities. If any
    arguments remain in input after validation, the call is refused. This
    implies the only way to get *any input at all* to the REST API is to
    introduce a validator code, which must actively process every piece
    of input to be used later in the actual method.

    When invoked by CherryPy, the class looks up the applicable handler by
    HTTP request method and the first URL path argument, runs validation,
    invokes the method, and formats the output, which should be some python
    data structure which can be rendered into JSON or XML, or some custom
    format (e.g. raw bytes for an image). For sequences and sequence-like
    results, the output is streamed out, object by object, as soon as the
    handler returns; the entire response is never built up in memory except
    as described below for compression and entity tag generation. As the
    assumption is that method will generate some pythonic data structure,
    the caller is required to specify via "Accept" header the desired
    output format.

    .. rubric:: Validation

    There is some general validation before invoking the API method. The
    HTTP method is first checked against allowed methods listed above, and
    those for which there is a registered API handler. The API is checked
    to be known, and that a handler has been registered for the combination
    of the two, and that method can produce output in the format requested
    by in the "Accept" header. The derived class can run :meth:`_precall`
    validation hook before the API name is popped off URL path arguments,
    in case it wants to pull other arguments such as database instance
    label from the URL first.

    The API-specific validation function is called with argument list
    *(apiobj, method, apiname, args, safeargs).* The *apiobj* is the metadata
    object for the API entry created by :meth:`_addAPI`, *method* the HTTP
    method, *apiname* the API name. The remaining two arguments are incoming
    and validated safe arguments, as described above for validation; both
    are instances of :class:`RESTArgs`.

    .. rubric:: Method call

    The API handler is invoked with arguments and keyword arguments saved
    into *safeargs* by the validation method. The method returns a value,
    which must be either a python string, a sequence or a generator.

    .. rubric:: Output formatting

    Once the REST API has returned a value, the class formats the output.
    For GET and HEAD requests, expire headers are set as specified by the
    API object. After that the format handler is invoked, whose output is
    compressed if allowed by the API and the HTTP request, and entity tag
    headers are processed and generated. Although the API may return data
    in any form for which there is a formatter (cf. :class:`~.JSONFormat`,
    :class:`~.XMLFormat` and :class:`~.RawFormat`) that can be matched to
    the request "Accept" header, the general assumption is APIs return
    "rows" of "objects" which are output with "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"
    in streaming format.

    It is supported and recommended that APIs verify the operation will
    very likely succeed, then return a python *generator* for the result,
    for example a database cursor for query results. This allows large
    responses to be streamed out as they are produced, without ever
    buffering the entire response as a string in memory.

    The output from the response formatter is sent to a compressor if the
    request headers include suitable "Accept-Encoding" header and the API
    object hasn't declined compression. Normally all output is compressed
    with ZLIB level 9 provided the client supports ``deflate`` encoding.
    It is recommended to keep compression enabled except if the output is
    known to be incompressible, e.g. images or compressed data files. The
    added CPU use is usually well worth the network communication savings.

    .. rubric:: Entity tags and response caching

    Before discussing caching, we note the following makes the implicit
    assumption that GET and HEAD requests are idempotent and repeatable
    withut ill effects. It is expected only PUT, POST and DELETE have
    side effects.

    All GET and HEAD responses will get an entity tag, or ETag, header. If
    the API does not generate an ETag, a hash digest is computed over the
    serialised response as it's written out, and included in the trailer
    headers of the response.

    If the API can compute an ETag in a better way than hashing the output,
    or can reply to If-Match / If-None-Match queries without computing the
    result, it should absolutely do so. Since most servers generate dynamic
    content such as database query results, it's hard to generate a useful
    ETag, and the scheme used here, a digest over the content, allows many
    clients like browsers to cache the responses. The server still has to
    re-execute the query and reformat the result to recompute the ETag, but
    avoids having to send matching responses back, and more importantly, the
    client learns its cached copy remains valid and can optimise accordingly.

    As a usability and performance optimisation, small GET/HEAD responses up
    to :attr:`etag_limit` bytes are buffered entirely, the ETag is computed,
    any If-Match, If-None-Match request headers are processed, the ETag is
    added to the response headers, and the entire body is output as a single
    string without the regular chunked streaming. This effectively allows
    web browser clients to cache small responses even if the API method is
    unable to compute a reliable ETag for it. This covers virtually all
    responses one would access in a browser for most servers in practice.

    The scheme also reduces network traffic since the body doesn't need to be
    output for successful cache validation queries, and when body is output,
    TCP tends to get fed more efficiently with larger output buffers. On the
    other hand the scheme degrades gracefully for large replies while allowing
    smarter clients, such as those using curl library to talk to the server,
    to get more out of the API, both performance and functionality wise.

    For large responses the computed digest ETag is still added as a trailer
    header, after all the output has been emitted. These will not be useful
    for almost any client. For one, many clients ignore trailers anyway. For
    another there is no way to perform If-Match / If-None-Match validation.

    The default digest algorithm is :class:`~.SHA1ETag`, configurable via
    :attr:`etagger`. The tagging and compression work also if the API uses
    CherryPy's ``serve_file()`` to produce the response.

    For GET responses to be cached by clients the response must include a
    both a "Cache-Control" header and an ETag (or "Last-Modified" time). If
    :attr:`default_expires` and :attr:`default_expires_opts` settings allow
    it, GET responses will include a "Cache-Control: max-age=n" header.
    These can be tuned per API with ``cherrypy.tools.expires(secs=n)``, or
    ``expires`` and ``expires_opts`` :func:`restcall` keyword arguments.

    .. rubric:: Notes

    .. note:: Only GET and HEAD requests are allowed to have a query string.
       Other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) may only have parameters specified
       in the request body. This is protection against XSRF attacks and in
       general attempts to engineer someone to submit a malicious HTML form.

    .. note:: The ETag generated by the default hash digest is computed from
       the formatted stream, before compression. It is therefore independent
       of "Accept-Encoding" request headers. However the ETag value is stable
       only if the formatter produces stable output given the same input. In
       particular any output which includes python dictionaries may vary over
       calls because of changes in dictionary key iteration order.

    .. warning:: The response generator returned by the API may fail after it
       has started to generate output. If the response is large enough not
       to fit in the ETag buffer, there is really no convenient way to stop
       producing output and indicate an error to the client since the HTTP
       headers have already been sent out with a good chunk of normal output.

       If the API-returned generator throws, this implementation closes the
       generated output by adding any required JSON, XML trailers and sets
       X-REST-Status and normal error headers in the trailer headers. The
       clients that understand trailer headers, such as curl-based ones, can
       use the trailer to discover the output is incomplete. Clients which
       ignore trailers, such as web browsers and python's urllib and httplib,
       will not know the output is truncated. Hence derived classes should be
       conservative about using risky constructs in the generator phase.

       Specifically any method with side effects should return a generator
       response only *after* all side effects have already taken place. For
       example when updating a database, the client should commit first,
       then return a generator. Because of how generators work in python,
       the latter step must be done in a separate function from the one that
       invokes commit!

       None of this really matters for responses which fit into the ETag
       buffer after compression. That is all but the largest responses in
       most servers, and the above seems a reasonable trade-off between
       not having to buffer huge responses in memory and usability.

    .. rubric:: Attributes

    .. attribute:: app

       Reference to the :class:`~.RESTMain` object from constructor.

    .. attribute:: config

       Reference to the :class:`WMCore.Configuraation` section for this API
       mount point as passed in to the constructor by :class:`~.RESTMain`.

    .. attribute:: methods

       A dictionary of registered API methods. The keys are HTTP methods,
       the values are another dictionary level with API name as a key, and
       an API object as a value. Do not modify this table directly, use the
       :meth:`_addAPI` method instead.

    .. attribute:: formats

       Possible output formats matched against "Accept" headers. This is a
       list of *(mime-type, formatter)* tuples. This is the general list of
       formats supported by this API entry point, with the intention that
       all or at least most API methods support these formats. Individual
       API methods can override the format list using ``formats`` keyword
       argument to :func:`restcall`, for example to specify list of image
       formats for one method which retrieves image files
       (cf. :class:`~.RawFormat`).

    .. attribute:: etag_limit

       An integer threshold for number of bytes to buffer internally for
       calculation of ETag header. See the description above for the full
       details on the scheme. The API object can override this limit with
       the ``etag_limit`` keyword argument to :func:`restcall`. The default
       is 8 MB.

    .. attribute:: compression

       A list of accepted compression mechanisms to be matched against the
       "Accept-Encoding" HTTP request header. Currently supported values are
       ``deflate`` and ``identity``. Using ``identity`` or emptying the list
       disables compression. The default is ``['deflate']``. Change this only
       for API mount points which are known to generate incompressible output,
       using ``compression`` keyword argument to :func:`restcall`.

    .. attribute:: compression_level

       Integer 0-9, the default ZLIB compression level for ``deflate`` encoding.
       The default is the maximum 9; for most servers the increased CPU use is
       usually well worth the reduction in network transmission costs. Setting
       the level to zero disables compression. The API can override this value
       with ``compression_level`` keyword argument to :func:`restcall`.

    .. attribute:: compression_chunk

       Integer, the approximate amount of input, in bytes, to consume to form
       compressed output chunks. The preferred value is the ZLIB compression
       horizon, 64kB. Up to this many bytes of output from the stream formatter
       are fed to the compressor, after which the compressor is flushed and the
       compressed output is emitted as HTTP transmission level chunk. Hence the
       receiving side can process chunks much like if the data wasn't compressed:
       the only difference is each HTTP chunk will contain an integral number of
       chunks instead of just one. (Of course in most cases the ETag buffering
       scheme will consume the output and emit it as a single unchunked part.)
       The API can override this value with ``compression_chunk`` keyword
       argument to :func:`restcall`.

    .. attribute:: default_expires

       Number, default expire time for GET / HEAD responses in seconds. The
       API object can override this value with ``expires`` keyword argument
       to :func:`restcall`. The default is one hour, or 3600 seconds.

    .. attribute:: default_expires_opts

       A sequence of strings, additional default options for "Cache-Control"
       response headers for responses with non-zero expire time limit. The
       strings are joined comma-separated to the "max-age=n" item. The API
       object can override this value with ``expires_opts`` keyword argument
       to :func:`restcall`. The default is an empty list.

class DBConnectionPool(Thread):
    """Asynchronous and robust database connection pool.

    .. rubric:: The pool

    This class provides a database connection pool that is thread safe
    and recovers as gracefully as possible from server side and network
    outages. Thread safety means that multiple threads may check out and
    return connections from or to the pool conncurrently. All connection
    management operations are internally transferred to a separate thread
    in order to guarantee client web server threads never block even if
    the database layer blocks or hangs in connection-related calls.

    In other words the effective purpose of this class is to guarantee
    web servers autonomously and gracefully enter a degraded state when
    the underlying database or network goes out, responding with "503
    database unavailable" but continuing to serve requests otherwise.
    Once database returns to operation the servers normally recover on
    their own without having to be manually restarted. While the main
    intent is to avoid requiring intervention on a production service,
    as a side effect this class makes database-based web services more
    usable on mobile devices with unstable network connections.

    The primary pooling purpose is to cache connections for databases
    for which connections are expensive, in particular Oracle. Instead
    of creating a new connection for each use, much of the time the pool
    returns a compatible idle connection which the application was done
    using. Connections unused for more than a pool-configured timeout are
    automatically closed.

    Between uses the connections are reset by rolling back any pending
    operations, and tested for validity by probing the server for
    "liveness" response. Connections failing tests are automatically
    disposed; when returning conections to the pool clients may indicate
    they've had trouble with it, and the pool will reclaim the connection
    instead of queuing it for reuse. In general it is hard to tell which
    errors involved connection-related issues, so it is safer to flag all
    errors on returning the connection. It is however better to filter
    out frequent benign errors such as integrity violations to avoid
    excessive connectin churn.

    Other database connection pool implementations exist, including for
    instance a session pool in the Oracle API (cx_Oracle's SessionPool).
    The reason this class implements pooling and not just validation is
    to side-step blocking or thread unsafe behaviour in the others. All
    connection management operations are passed to a worker thread. If
    the database connection layer stalls, HTTP server threads requesting
    connections will back off gracefully, reporting to their own clients
    that the database is currently unavailable. On the other hand no
    thread is able to create a connection to database if one connection
    stalls, but usually that would happen anyway with at least Oracle.

    The hand-over to the worker thread of course adds overhead, but the
    increased robustness and gracefulness in face of problems in practice
    outweighs the cost by far, and is in any case cheaper than creating
    a new connection each time. The level of overhead can be tuned by
    adjusting condition variable contention (cf. `num_signals`).

    The connections returned to clients are neither garbage collected
    nor is there a ceiling on a maximum number of connections returned.
    The client needs to be careful to `put()` as many connections as it
    received from `get()` to avoid leaking connections.

    .. rubric:: Pool specifications

    The database specification handed to the constructor should be a
    dictionary with the members:

    ``type``
      Reference to the DB API module, aka connection type.

    ``schema``
      String, name of the database schema the connection references.
      Sets connection ``current_schema`` attribute.

    ``clientid``
      String, identifies the client to session monitor, normally this
      should be `service-label@fully.qualified.domain`. Sets connection
      ``client_identifier`` attribute.

    ``liveness``
      String, SQL to execute to verify the connection remain usable,
      normally "``select sysdate from dual``" or alike. The statement
      should require a fresh response from the server on each execution
      so avoid "``select 1 from dual``" style cacheable queries.

    ``user``
      String, login user name.

    ``password``
      String, login password for ``user``.

    ``dsn``
      String, login data source name, usually the TNS entry name.

    ``timeout``
      Integer or float, number of seconds to retain unused idle
      connections before closing them. Note that this only applies to
      connections handed back to `put()`; connections given by `get()`
      but never returned to the pool are not considered idle, not even
      if the client loses the handle reference.

    ``stmtcache``
      Optional integer, overrides the default statement cache size 50.

    ``trace``
      Optional boolean flag, if set enables tracing of database activity
      for this pool, including connection ops, SQL executed, commits and
      rollbacks, and pool activity on the handles. If True, connections
      are assigned random unique labels which are used in activity log
      messages. Recycled idle connections also get a new label, but the
      connection log message will include the old label which allows
      previous logs on that connection to be found. Not to be confused
      with database server side logging; see ``session-sql`` for that.

    ``auth-role``
      Optional, (NAME, PASSWORD) string sequence. If set, connections
      acquire the database role *NAME* before use by executing the SQL
      "``set role none``", "``set role NAME identified by PASSWORD``"
      on each `get()` of the connection. In other words, if the role is
      removed or the password is changed, the client will automatically
      shed the role and fail with an error, closing the connection in
      the process, despite connection caching.

    ``session-sql``
      Optional sequence of SQL statement strings. These are executed on
      each connection `get()`. Use with session trace statements such as
      "``alter session set sql_trace = true``",
      "``alter session set events '10046 trace name context forever,
      level 12'``". It's not recommended to make any database changes.

    .. rubric:: Connection handles

    The `get()` method returns a database connection handle, a dict with
    the following members. The exact same dict needs to be returned to
    `put()` -- not a copy of it.

    ``type``
      Reference to DB API module.

    ``pool``
      Reference to this pool object.

    ``connection``
      Reference to the actual DB API connection object.

    ``trace``
      Always present, but may be either boolean False, or a non-empty
      string with the trace message prefix to use for all operations
      concerning this connection.

    .. rubric:: Attributes

    .. attribute:: connection_wait_time

       Number, the maximum time in seconds to wait for a connection to
       complete after which the client will be told the database server
       is unavailable.  This should be large enough to avoid triggering
       unnecessary database unavailability errors in sporadic delays in
       production use, but low enough to bounce clients off when the
       database server is having difficulty making progress.

       In particular client HTTP threads will be tied up this long if
       the DB server is completely hanging: completing TCP connections
       but not the full database handshake, or if TCP connection itself
       is experiencing significant delays. Hence it's important to keep
       this value low enough for the web server not to get dogged down
       or fail with time-out errors itself.

    .. attribute:: wakeup_period

       Number, maximum time in seconds to wait in the worker thread main
       loop before checking any timed out connections. The server does
       automatically adjust the wake-up time depending on work needed,
       so there usually isn't any need to change this value. The value
       should not be decreased very low to avoid an idle server from
       waking up too often.

    .. attribute:: num_signals

       Number of condition variables to use for signalling connection
       completion. The pool creates this many condition variables and
       randomly picks one to signal connection completion between the
       worker and calling threads. Increase this if there is a high
       degree of thread contention on concurrent threads waiting for
       connection completion. The default should be fine for all but
       highest connection reuse rates.

    .. attribute:: max_tries

       The maximum number of times to attempt creating a connection
       before giving up. If a connection fails tests, it is discarded
       and another attempt is made with another connection, either an
       idle one or an entirely new connection if no idle ones remain.
       This variable sets the limit on how many times to try before
       giving up. This should be high enough a value to consume any
       cached bad connections rapidly enough after network or database
       failure. Hence the pool will reclaim any bad connections at the
       maximum rate of `get()` calls times `max_tries` per
       `connection_wait_time`.

       Do not set this value to a very high value if there is a real
       possibility of major operational flukes leading to connection
       storms or account lock-downs, such as using partially incorrect
       credentials or applications with invalid/non-debugged SQL which
       cause connection to be black-listed and recycled. In other words,
       only change this parameter for applications which have undergone
       significant testing in a production environment, with clear data
       evidence the default value is not leading to sufficiently fast
       recovery after connections have started to go sour.

    .. attribute:: dbspec

       Private, the database specification given to the constructor.

    .. attribute:: id

       Private, the id given to the constructor for trace logging.

    .. attribute:: sigready

       Private, `num_signals` long list of condition variables for
       signalling connection attempt result.

    .. attribute:: sigqueue

       Private, condition variable for signalling changes to `queue`.

    .. attribute:: queue

       Private, list of pending requests to the worker thread, access
       to which is protected by `sigqueue`. Connection release requests
       go to the front of the list, connection create requests at the
       end. The worker thread takes the first request in queue, then
       executes the action with `sigqueue` released so new requests can
       be added while the worker is talking to the database.

    .. attribute:: inuse

       Private, list of connections actually handed out by `get()`. Note
       that if the client has already given up on the `get()` request by
       the time the connection is finally established, the connection is
       automatically discarded and not put no this list. This list may be
       accessed only in the worker thread as no locks are available to
       protect the access; `logstatus()` method provides the means to log
       the queue state safely in the worker thread.

    .. attribute:: idle

       Private, list of idle connections, each of which has ``expires``
       element to specify the absolute time when it will expire. The
       worker thread schedules to wake up within five seconds after the
       next earliest expire time, or in `wakeup_period` otherwise, and
       of course whenever new requests are added to `queue`. This list
       may be accessed only in the work thread as no locks are available
       to protect the access; `logstatus()` method provides the means to
       log the queue state safely in the worker thread.

    .. rubric:: Constructor

    The constructor automatically attaches this object to the cherrypy
    engine start/stop messages so the background worker thread starts or
    quits, respectively. The pool does not attempt to connect to the
    database on construction, only on the first call to `get()`, so it's
    safe to create the pool even if network or database are unavailable.

class DatabaseRESTApi(RESTApi):
    """A :class:`~.RESTApi` whose entities represent database contents.

    This class wraps API calls into an environment which automatically sets
    up and tears down a database connection around the call, and translates
    all common database errors such as unique constraint violations into an
    appropriate and meaningful :class:`~.RESTError`-derived error.

    This class is fundamentally instance-aware. The :meth:`_precall` hook is
    used to pop a required instance argument off the URL, before the API name,
    so URLs look like ``/app/prod/entity``. The instance name from the URL is
    used to select the database instance on which the API operates, and the
    HTTP method is used to select suitable connection pool, for example reader
    account for GET operations and a writer account for PUT/POST/DELETE ones.

    Normally the entities do not use database connection directly, but use
    the convenience functions in this class. These methods perform many
    utility tasks needed for high quality implementation, plus make it very
    convenient to write readable REST entity implementations which conform
    to the preferred API conventions. For example the :meth:`query` method
    not only executes a query, but it runs a SQL statement cleaner, does all
    the SQL execution trace logging, keeps track of last statement executed
    with its binds (to be logged with error output in case an exception is
    raised later on), fills ``rest_generate_preamble["columns"]`` from the
    SQL columns titles, and returns a generator over the result, optionally
    filtering the results by a regular expression match criteria.

    The API configuration must include ``db`` value, whose value should be
    the qualified name of the python object for the multi-instance database
    authentication specification. The object so imported should yield a
    dictionary whose keys are the supported instance names. The values should
    be dictionaries whose keys are HTTP methods and values are dictionaries
    specifying database contact details for that use; "*" can be used as a
    key for "all other methods". For example the following would define two
    instances, "prod" and "dev", with "prod" using a reader account for GETs
    and a writer account for other methods, and "dev" with a single account::

      DB = { "prod": { "GET": { "user": "foo_reader", ... },
                       "*":   { "user": "foo_writer", ... } },
             "dev":  { "*":   { "user": "foo", ... } } }

    The class automatically uses a thread-safe, resilient connection pool
    for the database connections (cf. :class:`~.DBConnectionPool`). New
    database connections are created as needed on demand. If the database is
    unavailable, the server will gracefully degrade to reporting HTTP "503
    Service Unavailable" status code. Database availability is not required
    on server start-up, connections are first attempted on the first HTTP
    request which requires a connection. In fact connections are prepared
    only *after* request validation has completed, mainly as a security
    measure to prevent unsafe parameter validation code from mixing up with
    database query execution. At the end of API method execution connection
    handles are automatically rolled back, so API should explicitly commit
    if it wants any changes made to last. Sending the server SIGUSR2 signal
    will log connection usage statistics and pool timeouts.

    .. rubric:: Attributes

    .. attribute:: _db

        Normally you would use this method via :meth:`modify`, but it can be
        called directly to verify each step of multi-statement update operation.

        This method exists so that a REST entity can be written easily to have
        a documented invariant, which is likely to always pass, and needs to
        be checked with very low overhead -- aka each modify operation touches
        the exact number of database objects requested, and attempts to act on
        non-existent objects are caught and properly reported to clients. It
        enables trivially one to use ``INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...`` statement
        style for insertions, deletions and updates. If the SELECT part returns
        fewer or more results than expected, an exception will be raised and the
        transaction rolled back even if the schema constraints do not catch the
        problem.

        In other words the check here makes sure that any app logic or database
        schema constraint mistakes turn into hard API errors rather than making
        hash out of the database contents, or lying to clients that an operation
        succeeded when it did not actually fully perform the requested task. It
        eliminates the need to proliferate result checking code through the app
        and to worry about a large class of possible race conditions in clustered
        web services talking to databases.

    functions as described in :class:`~.RESTApi` documentation.

    Do note that keyword arguments with defaults are pointless on HTTP method
    handlers: the methods are never called in a fashion that would actually
    use the declaration defaults. Specifically, every argument stored into
    ``safe.kwargs`` by a validator will always be given *some* value. If the

    be given `None` value when not present in the request arguments.

    """Mark a method for use in REST API calls.

    This is a decorator to mark a callable, such as :class:`~.RESTEntity`
    method, an exposed REST interface. It must be applied on functions and
    methods given to :meth:`.MiniRESTApi._addAPI` and :meth:`.RESTApi._add`.
    It can be used either as bare-word or function-like decorator: both
    ``@restcall def f()`` and ``@restcall(foo=bar) def f()`` forms work.

    The `args` should be the parameter names accepted by the decorated
    function. If `args` is the default None, the possible arguments are
    extracted with :func:`inspect.getargspec`.

    The `generate` argument sets the label used by output formatters to
    surround the output. The default is "result", yielding for example
    JSON output ``{"result": [ ... ]}`` and XML output ``<app><result>
    ... </result></app>``

    The `kwargs` can supply any configuration variables which are known to
    other parts of the REST API implementation. The arguments eventually
    become fields in the "API object" created by :meth:`.MiniRESTApi._addAPI`,
    and accessible among other things to the validator functions. The most
    commonly used arguments include those listed below. See the rest of
    the module documentation for the details on them.
