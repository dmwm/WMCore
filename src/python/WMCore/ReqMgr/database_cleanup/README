Utilities for:
    - dumping Oracle ReqMgr database into Python dictionaries
    - comparison / consistency between ReqMgr Oracle database and CouchDB
    - ultimate goal is to drop Oracle database from ReqMgr, keeping data only
        in CouchDB
    - as of 2013-01-16, ReqMgr Oracle database dump (in Python dictionaries)
        is slightly under 900MB, approx. half is in the reqmgr_message table


1) python ./oracle_dump.py user/password@server > oracle_dump.py
    -dump the entire database into Python dictionaries
    -this is run on VM after (makes WMCore libs available):
        source /data/current/apps/reqmgr/etc/profile.d/init.sh
1.1) python ./oracle_dump.py user/password@server reqmgr_request > \
            oracle_dump_request_table.py
    -dumps only reqmgr_request table
2) python oracle_couchdb_comparison.py > comparison.log
    -make comparison
    -must have CMS web credentials available in env. vars, WMCore libs
