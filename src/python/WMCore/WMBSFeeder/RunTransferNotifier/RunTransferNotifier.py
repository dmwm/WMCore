_RunTransferNotifier_

Health warning: Unfinished code (trains are great, working on Saturday isn't)

WMBS Feeder which looks for new runs, and inserts files to filesets when all
files for a given run are transferred to a site. Also handles Parent files
when required (waits for children + parents for a run to be transferred).

Algorithm:

1. Look for new runs in DBS. If new runs found, add to WatchedRuns list
2. For every fileset, ensure a dataset entry is present in each WatchedRun to
    monitor location transfers. This ensures new registered filesets will take
    advantage of currently watched runs
3. For every fileset, query DBS against all WatchedRuns to find all blocks
    associated to the run and dataset
3.1    If required, find all associated parent blocks and add to block list
3.2    For every block, query PhEDEx to find sites where block is complete
3.3    When all blocks for a dataset are present at a site, check node is not
        already in WatchedRuns dataset:location mapping
3.4    If no mapping, add node to the WatchedRuns dataset:location mapping and
        fill fileset with primary files
4. Purge WatchedRuns older than n hours

TODO:   * Make parent relations condition on actually requiring parent relation
             -- c.f. Talk with Simon about fileset name to specify datasets
        * DQ flags from DBS?
        * Finish tracking down DBS problems
