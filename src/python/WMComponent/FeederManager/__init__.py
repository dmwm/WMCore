_FeederManager_

    A FeederManager associates filesets of interest with feeders (DBS, PhEDEx
etc.) and calls the feeders to populate the WMBS with new/updated files.

    Also provide some method for callbacks to feeders such that the feeders can
persist state. This will need to know data type and appropriate mappings -
maybe persist to config type file instead of a database, as the state will be
complex and varied.

    The FeederManager may need to evaluate reg exp's in fileset names... tbd
