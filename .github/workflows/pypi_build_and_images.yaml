# This workflow will build and upload WMCore core services to the production PyPI
# based on tag releases, see build_and_publish_services job. Then, the second
# named build_images, will build appropriate docker images using CMSKubernetes
# Dockefiles and upload them to CERN registry.
#
# The build_and_publish_services job relies on pypi_build_template.yaml
# The build_images relies on docker_images_template.yaml template
# Each job use matrics target (as input list to iterate) and setup
# wmcore_component which is used by corresponding template to perform
# set of actions. We also define here necessary secrets used by given template.
